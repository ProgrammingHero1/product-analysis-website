### Special Notes
1. To install recharts run:

`npm install recharts --force`

2. If you see the following warning, ignore it for now. 

`Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18. Use createRoot instead. Until you switch to the new API, your app will behave as if it's running React 17. Learn more: https://reactjs.org/link/switch-to-createroot`

3. For the dashboard, you can modify the data provided in `data.json` and you can load the data the way you want.
